# Finding the best predictors of the per-night Airbnb price in Quebec City, QC.

## Summary
In our model, we built a regresion model using a Random Forest Regressor, XGB Regressor, and Support Vector Regression, along with cross-validation with GridSearchCV. The best model (best test score) was the Random Forest Regressor, which had a test accuracy of 75%. We did not implement model selection and features engineering, but plan to incorporate these concepts as well as test reproducibility of our findings on other AirBnb datasets. 

## Introduction
The Airbnb rental market has grown immensely since its inception in 2008. As of 2019, there are more than 7 million listings worldwide, and on average, there are 2 million people staying in an Airbnb per night. (Airbnb 2019) Those renting out their properties as Airbnbs are called hosts, and are able to set and adjust their own prices. These often serve as an important source of secondary, or even primary income for hosts. There are many different factors that determine whether an individual will choose to rent an Airbnb or not, and new hosts often struggle with setting a fair and competitive price. There have been some peer-reviewed studies done in the past examining what the most important predictors are, and results range from host reviews (Teubner 2017) to the host having a profile picture (Ert 2016). 

Here, we try to determine the most important predictors for the per-night price of an Airbnb in Quebec City. Answering this question is important because could help new hosts determine what price to set their rental at, as well as could help existing hosts determine what the most high-yield improvements could be if they'd like to raise the per-night price of their unit. 

## Methods
### Data
The data set used in this project is from Airbnb. Each year, Airbnb publishes data on their website for all the listings made that year, separated by major city. We used the Quebec City data set, as it is a Canadian city with a wide range of rental prices. Additionally, this data set is relatively small (~2700 rows), which we preferred as, given the time constraints for this project, working with a huge data set would have proven especially challenging.

The data contain many features, including the unit's geographic coordinates, the hosts' average ratings, and the number of beds in the unit. In total, there are about 45 columns that we utilized in our review after removing blank/NaN-filled columns. Each row in the data set is for a separate listing in Quebec City. 

### Analysis
For our model prediction, we have chosen Random Forest Regressor, XGBRegressor, and Support Vector Regressor as our models, in conjunction with cross validation technique using GridSearchCV. Cross validation helped in tuning different parameters to ensure optimal choice and results. We also chose the default accuracy metric. We have chosen these models because they have proven to have better predictive performances than other regressors, and because linear regression was not an option since our exploratory data analysis revealed an unclear linear relationship with our response variable `price`.

The R (R Core Team 2019) and Python (Van Rossum and Drake 2019) programming languages and the following R and Python packages were used to perform the analysis: Xgboost(Chen 2016), docopt(de Jonge 2018), Matplotlib (Hunter 2007),  knitr(Xie 2014), tidyverse (Wickham 2017), docopt(Keleshev 2014), Pandas (McKinney 2010), Altair (VanderPlas 2018). The code used to perform the analysis and create this report is available [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_522_Group313). 

## Results and Discussion

As a result of hyperparameter optimization, the model takes approximately 48 seconds to run and it fits different models and hyperparameters. The best model turns out to be Random Forest Regressor with test accuracy of 75%, followed by Support Vector Regressor with test accuracy of 66% and lastly XGBRegressor which was run without hyperparameter optimization as a control model with test accuracy of 63%.

Table 1: This graph shows that the Random Forest Regressor had the highest test accuracy, which is why we chose that model to move forward with. 

The best set of hyperparameter for the best model: Random Forest Regressor is {'max_depth': 25, 'max_features': 'sqrt', 'min_samples_split': 2, 'n_estimators': 100}.

For the Random Forest Regressor, the 5 most important features were: 

1. `calculated_host_listings_count_entire_homes`, which were the number of houses each host had up. 

2. `bathrooms`, the number of bathrooms in the unit.

3. `calculated_host_listings_count`, which were the number of listings each host had up. 

4. `longitude`, the longitude of the rental unit.

5. `latitude`, the latitude of the rental unit. 

This shows that, perhaps new hosts could increse the number of units they have up on Airbnb, as well as potentially increasing the number of bathrooms in the unit. The longitude and latitude are not changeable, but perhaps a host could look into the latitude and longitude of a new property they are planning on purchasing if they intend to rent it out as an Airbnb. 

To improve this model in the future, we we will implement model selection and feature engineering so as to focus on the important features and not risk dropping important features and using less important ones. We will build a model pipeline and run analysis using more regressors.

Another next step involves re-doing these analyses on other, larger Airbnb datasets (e.g. Vancouver) to observe whether these "most-important predictors" are generalizable to other datasets, or only apply to the Quebec City data set.
