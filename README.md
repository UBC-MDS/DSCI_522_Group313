## About
In our project, we attempt to build a regression model using multiple linear regression, generalized linear regression, and random forest regression to find the best predictors for the price per night of an Airbnb in Quebec city. Airbnbs are often a popular option for those who are looking for low-cost, short-term rentals, and can often be a source of secondary income for hosts. **< summarize findings here >**. 

This analysis could prove useful for 2 major groups of individuals: (1) individuals who are looking to rent out one of their properties as an Airbnb, and are looking for a potential price to charge, and (2) individuals who currently rent out their properties as an Airbnb ('hosts'), and are trying to determine how best to increase the valuation of the rental property. 

## Usage

Please refer to the [README.md file in the src folder of this repo](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_522_Group313/tree/master/src).
