## Proposal

### Data Set
[Forest Fires Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Forest+Fires)

This data set aims to predict the area burned by forest fires in the North-East Portugal region. It includes 517 rows and 13 attributes, including temperature, rain, wind, and month. 

### Research Question

Our main research question is: How can one predict the severity of a forest fire? *Note: severity is indicated by the total area burned by the fire*. More specifically, we are interested in analyzing how the the various attributes from the dataset affect forest fire severity, as well as possible interactions between attributes.

### Analysis Plan

Multiple linear regression (continuous outcome)
